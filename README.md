## 📖 About The Project

**Graphly** is an all-in-one platform designed to help students and developers master graph algorithms. Whether you are a beginner trying to understand BFS or an advanced coder practicing for interviews, Graphly provides the tools you need.

The platform combines theoretical articles, interactive visualizations, a "LeetCode-style" coding judge, and a structured roadmap - all powered by an intelligent AI assistant.

## 🚀 Key Features

Graphly is divided into four main modules designed to guide you from novice to expert.

### 1. Learn

Grasp the theory before diving into code.

- **Concise Articles:** Simple, easy-to-read explanations of complex graph concepts.
- **Quizzes:** Test your knowledge immediately after reading to ensure retention.

<h3>📖 Conceptual Clarity</h3>
<p>
  Clean, distraction-free articles that break down complex graph theories into simple terms. 
  Includes snippets of code and diagrams.
</p>

</div>

<h3>📝 Immediate Reinforcement</h3>
<p>
  Test your understanding right after reading. 
  Interactive quizzes ensure you've grasped the core concepts before moving to the Visualization phase.
</p>

</div>

### 2. Visualize

The heart of Graphly. Don't just read code - watch it run.

- **Interactive Visualization:** Nodes are fully **draggable**. Rearrange the graph layout to better understand complex connections.
- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Step through algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.).
- **Dynamic Coloring:** Watch nodes and edges **change color** in real-time to visually track the algorithm's progress.
- **Step-by-Step Navigation:** Control the flow via UI buttons or use **keyboard arrows** (← / →) to step backward and forward through the execution.
- **Live Data Structures:** See exactly what is inside the Queue, Stack, or Priority Queue at every step.
- **Reference Code:** Sample code is displayed alongside the graph to help you correlate the visual steps with standard algorithmic logic.
- **Custom Graphs:** Edit the graph using a simple text syntax.

### 3. Solve (Powered by Judge0)

Practice makes perfect. A built-in coding environment similar to LeetCode.

- **Language Support:** Write solutions in **Python** using the embedded Monaco Editor.
- **Two Execution Modes:**
  - **▶️ Run:** Test your code against local, visible test cases to debug logic.
  - **✅ Submit:** Validate your solution against hidden database test cases.
- **AI Performance Insights:** Upon a successful submission (Accepted), GraphlyAI automatically analyzes your code. It provides a detailed breakdown of **Time & Space Complexity** and offers actionable tips to further optimize or refactor your solution.
- **Test Case Feedback:** Clear JSON-based feedback on pass/fail status.

<h3>👨‍💻 The Coding Workspace</h3>
<p>
  The problem interface features a full-screen description, test case manager, and a Monaco-based Python editor. 
  Users can verify logic against local test cases before submitting.

</div>

<h3>🤖 Submission & AI Insights</h3>
<p>
  After a successful submission, <b>Judge0</b> returns runtime stats. 
  Simultaneously, <b>GraphlyAI</b> analyzes the code to explain Time/Space complexity and suggests optimizations.
</p>

### 4. Roadmap

A structured learning tree to guide your journey from basic traversals to advanced algorithms.

- **Dependency Tree:** Shows the logical order of learning (e.g., learn DFS before Topological Sort).
- **Curated Problems:** Links to example problems from top coding platforms for each topic.

<h3>🌳 The Big Picture</h3>
<p>
  A visual dependency tree representing the optimal learning path. 
  Nodes light up as you master concepts, tracking your progress from BFS to Network Flow.
</p>

</div>

<h3>🔗 Curated Practice Problems</h3>
<p>
  Click on any node (e.g., "Topological Sort") to reveal a curated list of high-quality problems 
  from platform like LeetCode, specific to that topic.
</p>

## 🤖 GraphlyAI Assistant

Stuck? GraphlyAI is available on every page.

- **Context-Aware:** Select any text on the screen (article, code, or problem description) and click **"Ask GraphlyAI"** for specific help.
- **Coding Helper:** Ask for hints, time complexity analysis, or debugging help in the Solve module.

## 🛠️ Graph Syntax

In the **Visualize** section, you can create your own graphs using a simple text-based format.

**Format:** `Source--Target:Weight`

**Examples:**

- `1--2:5` (Connects node 1 to node 2 with weight 5)
- `A--B:10`
  (Connects node A to node B with weight 10)

Just type the relationships, and the graph renders instantly!

## 🏁 Getting Started

To run Graphly locally, you need Docker installed.

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Lukas249/Graphly.git
    cd graphly
    ```

2.  **Set up Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY=api key from https://aistudio.google.com/
    GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_MODEL_NAME=gemini-3-flash-preview

    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://graphly-web:3000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_JUDGE0_URL=http://judge0-server:2358

    REDIS_URL=redis://graphly-redis:6379

    MYSQL_USER=user
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
    MYSQL_DATABASE=nextjs_db

    DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@graphly-mysql:3306/nextjs_db
    ```

3.  **Run with Docker Compose**
    This will start the all needed services.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the App**
    Open `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port) in your browser.

## 🔧 Judge0 Configuration

The `judge0/judge0.conf` file handles the configuration for the code execution engine. Crucially, it defines authentication credentials:

- `REDIS_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

> **Note:** By default, these are set to `password`.
